# Image2Image-GANs-Translation-App

An Image to image translation app in which we have used Rapid API.

# RAPID API
RapidAPI serves as a user-friendly platform that gives developers easy access to a wide 
range of data and API services and enables seamless integration with their applications. 
With RapidAPI, developers can streamline their development process and greatly minimize 
the amount of code they have to write by hand. (https://rapidapi.com/)

# Cartoon Yourself API
Using the advanced technology of generative adversarial network, we can overcome the 
limitations of traditional methods and achieve breakthroughs called "next generation walls" 
with just one click. This development allows us to capture and store the user's features in 
different dimensions, resulting in many faces, each with its own set of features. In addition, 
our technology covers a wide range of comic-style image transformations, enabling us to 
create highly lovable comic faces with artistic beauty.

# Effect GAN
An example of a generative adversarial network (GAN) is Effect GAN, commonly referred 
to as E-GAN, which focuses on creating image-to-image translations. Traditional GANs are 
made to create new images from noise, whereas Effect GANs are made to learn how to map 
input photos to desired output images with specified alterations or effects.
